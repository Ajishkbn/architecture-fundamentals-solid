# 🏛️ Architecture Fundamentals: SOLID Principles

Welcome to **Architecture-Fundamentals-SOLID**! This repository is dedicated to exploring the **SOLID** principles of object-oriented design. Through practical code examples and detailed explanations, you'll see how these principles help create **robust**, **maintainable**, and **scalable** software architectures. 🌟

## 📜 Contents

### 🧩 [Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)](./solid/1-S-SRP.md)

**Keep it simple!** Examples demonstrate how to keep classes focused on a **single responsibility** to improve clarity and reduce complexity.

### 🔄 [Open/Closed Principle (OCP)](./solid/2-O-OCP.md)

**Extend without modifying!** Code illustrating how to design systems that are **open for extension but closed for modification** to enable flexible and adaptable architectures.

### 🧱 [Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)](./solid/3-L-LSP.md)

**Stay compatible!** Code that shows **substitutable subclasses** adhering to their base classes’ behavior, helping to ensure consistent behavior across implementations.

### 🎛️ [Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)](./solid/4-I-ISP.md)

**Avoid overload!** Examples illustrate how to avoid **forcing clients to depend on interfaces they do not use**, promoting modular and clean design.

### 🔌 [Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)](./solid/5-D-DIP.md)

**Abstract over detail!** Code showing the importance of **high-level modules not depending on low-level modules**, but rather on abstractions, fostering loose coupling and greater flexibility.

---

Each principle is illustrated with **clear, concise code** in multiple programming languages 🛠️, along with insightful commentary on best practices ✅ and potential pitfalls ⚠️.

This repository serves as a **foundational resource** for anyone looking to master SOLID principles and enhance their software architecture skills. 🚀
